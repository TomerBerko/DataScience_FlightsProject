# DataScience_FlightsProject
This is a repository which represents a final project of an academic Data Science course.

Can we predict if a flight is LowCost or not using data from the flight?
The process of getting the answer is built on several stages which are executed by algorithmic functions in Python:

ðŸ“¡ Getting The Data - Crawling & Scrapping a data filled web-site and the crawling involved the "selelnium" and "bs4" python modules.
ðŸ“‹ Data Handling - Cleaning corrupt values and removing rows of missing data to prepare the data for analysation.
ðŸ“Š Visualization & Analysation - Creating a clear way to analyse and show behaviors from the data properties with graphs.
ðŸ¤– Machine Learning - Creating a trained model which takes the data and predicts if the flight is LowCost flight or not without the airline name and even the flight time.
